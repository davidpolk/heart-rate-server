# Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a server that would allow users to create and log in to their accounts to track their heart rate and blood oxygen saturation whenever they please. The heart rate monitor is comprised by a MAX30102 Pulse Detection Blood Oxygen sensor that is connected the a Particle Photon IoT device. The server is to run on AWS EC2 Server, and use a MongoDB database for storage. The heart rate sensor takes measurements at periodic intervals throughout the day and effectively sends them to the server, where users can track their data.
